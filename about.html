                    <p><b>Have you ever not known what to wear?</b> It can be difficult knowing how to balance expressing your personality in your wardrobe choices with following (sometimes strict) professionl dress codes. We've recruited some of the most fashionable people we know to discuss and present examples of work attire appropriate for various levels of formality in multiple industry settings. Clothing choices are a big part of first impressions, and it is important to know how to meet expectations of professionalism without having to compromise or conceal the parts of your identity that you want to express. We certainly aren't experts, but we do have some advice on finding the right balance and hope to hear from you as well! Please join us in your favorite professional outfit (feel free to bring a photo instead) or just come to hang out.</p>
